            <h3 class="text-info">Early Personal Projects - Childhood to 2015</h3>
            <p class="text-light">
                I always had a strong interest in programming.
                Some computer science related projects I pursued included creating Scratch games,
                making small interactive C++ scripts, and basic modding using Java and SQL.
                <br/>In elementary school, I attended some robotics clubs that showed us how to use legos
                and a beginner microcontroller boards to create small robots to complete different unique tasks.
                <br/>During middle school, I attended VEX Robotics during the sack attack year and was the main programmer (Using Robot-C).
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-info">Battlefield High School - 2015 to June 2019</h3>
            <p class="text-light">
                Graduated from Battlefield High School with a 4.34 GPA and class rank 22 of 688.
                Obtained an IT Gold Medal for taking a substantial amount of STEM related electives.
                <br/>Attended Several volunteer clubs including two general volunteer clubs (Key club and NHS club) and
                a teaching club where we worked as elementary teacher's assistants (STAR club).
                <br/>Took a different Computer Science class each year:
                "Advanced Computer Math" where we learned the basics of Java;
                "AP Computer Science" where we prepared to take the AP test for Computer Science which would count as college credit;
                "Data Structures" where we delved into the concepts of different data structures such as Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, and more;
                "4th Year Computer Science Studies" where we worked on many different advanced projects.
                In the fourth year CS studies class, we went in depth, learning non-conventional languages such as Haskell.
                We also pursued our own approved projects where my group (two others) and I decided to structure
                and draft our own unique programming language (using Java as a base language for simplicity) for pedagogical purposes.
                Though the project had many errors and faults, it taught us many concepts that I would not learn until my third year at George Mason University.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-info">VEX Robotics - 2015 to 2018</h3>
            <p class="text-light">
                Worked as part of team 180 (a private VEX team), which was later split to team 180A and 180X.
                Designed and built different VEX robots as well as programmed code for robot autonomous.
                Attended the VEX State Competition as well as the VEX World Competition every year.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-info">FRC Robotics - 2019</h3>
            <p class="text-light">
                Worked as part of ILITE (team 1885) at Battlefield High School.
                Worked alongside the ILITE programming team (other Battlefield students and a few volunteer mentors)
                using the team's Java repository.
                As the lead telemetry programmer, wrote all telemetry related code as well as core robot traversal code.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-info">Potbelly Sandwich Shop Associate - 2019 to 2020</h3>
            <p class="text-light">
                Worked part-time for a year (before the Covid-19 pandemic).
                Made sandwiches, milkshakes, and desserts as well as closed up shop.
                Taught me that even lower paying jobs are really physically tough
                and that I should have nothing but the highest respect for retail/minimum-wage workers.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-info">Research Assistant - 2019 to 2022</h3>
            <p class="text-light">
                Worked as a Research Assistant at George Mason University for a study analysing and expanding the known network of malicious blockchain activity.
                Responsibilities include: drafting and testing MySQL scripts that provide automation in locating and flagging suspicious blockchain addresses,
                creating python scripts to manage a blockchain's node's blocks and analyze interactions in all transactions.
                <br/>The biggest challenge during the projects pursued in this job was managing storage and memory due to the sheer size of the blockchain nodes.
                <br/>The main blockchain currencies analyzed were Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, and Ethereum.
            </p>

                the website development project for the USPTO Trademark Systems division.
                Took some of the many classes they offered relating to agile development.
                On the side, I also messed around with / worked on a fork of the USPTO Trademark website.

                DNS Client Translation</h3>
            <p class="text-light">
                The purpose of this project was to take in a url string and
                return the ip address correlated to the string.
                This was done by manually sending the bit by bit created byte stream request to the DNS server.

                Movie Review Sentiment Prediction</h3>
            <p class="text-light">
                This script analyzes the sentiment (positive or negative)
                of a movie review based on the connotation of the words in the review.
                The script has a training phase and testing phase.
                During the training phase, the code loops through a file
                with several thousand reviews as well as their classification (positive or negative review).
                With this information, the code predicts the sentiment of the reviews in the testing file.
                <br/>This project was done as a part of my Data Mining class (CS 484).

                Naive Bayes / Machine Learning Drug Analysis</h3>
            <p class="text-light">
                This python script analyzes different drug compounds.
                The technical description of this project is to determine which given
                compound records are active (binding) and which are inactive (non-binding).
                A big caveat to this project was the imbalanced distribution in the training set where
                10% of the training records are classified as active and 90% are classified as inactive.
                The training occurs on 800 different classified records and the test dataset occurs on 350 different records.
                In the main python script, there are two different approaches to this problem.
                There is the Naive Bayes algorithm which is a simple algorithm that calculates based on
                summed probability of each compound feature (dimension).
                There is also a machine learning approach that utilizes the Scikit-Learn python library
                to create a multilevel neural network.
                <br/>This project was done as a part of my Data Mining Class (CS484)

            <h3 class="text-info project" onclick="window.location.href='https://github.com/ChangJoseph/Toyger-Scanner-and-Parser'">
                Toyger Scanner and Parser</h3>
            <p class="text-light">
                This language parser takes in a file and analyzes it ensuring basic syntax and semantics.

                A compiler for our Toyger language, which is inspired by Tiger
                (Andrew Appel, Modern Compiler Implementation in C, Cambridge University Press)
                but a much simplified version. A scanner and a parser to perform syntax analysis for a subset of
                Toyger programs using lex (flex, jflex) with lexical analysis and a recursive descent parser for
                syntax checking. Able to generate a report for an input program.

                <br/>This project was done as a part of my Natural Language Processing class.
